Django Signals

Question 1: Are Django signals executed synchronously or asynchronously by default?
By default, Django signals are executed synchronously.
This means the signal handlers are executed immediately after the signal is sent, within the same thread of execution.

example code:
import time
from django.db.models.signals import post_save
from django.dispatch import receiver
from django.contrib.auth.models import User

@receiver(post_save, sender=User)
def signal_handler(sender, instance, **kwargs):
    print(f"Signal received for user: {instance.username}")
    time.sleep(5)  # Simulating a long-running task
    print("Signal handler finished execution")

# Simulating user creation
user = User(username="testuser")
user.save()

print("User save method completed")
In this example, when a user is saved, the signal handler is called synchronously.
The time.sleep(5) will block the execution, and we will see that "User save method completed" only prints after the signal handler finishes execution, proving that the signal is executed synchronously.





Question 2: Do Django signals run in the same thread as the caller?
Yes, by default, Django signals run in the same thread as the caller.

Hereâ€™s a code snippet to prove this:

import threading
from django.db.models.signals import post_save
from django.dispatch import receiver
from django.contrib.auth.models import User

@receiver(post_save, sender=User)
def signal_handler(sender, instance, **kwargs):
    print(f"Signal received for user: {instance.username}")
    print(f"Signal handler thread: {threading.current_thread().name}")

# Simulating user creation
user = User(username="testuser")
user.save()

print(f"Main thread: {threading.current_thread().name}")

Output:
Signal received for user: testuser
Signal handler thread: MainThread
Main thread: MainThread

As seen in the output, both the main thread and the signal handler thread are the same (MainThread), showing that Django signals run in the same thread by default.



Question 3: Do Django signals run in the same database transaction as the caller?
Yes, by default, Django signals run in the same database transaction as the caller.

code snippet to prove this:


from django.db import transaction
from django.db.models.signals import post_save
from django.dispatch import receiver
from django.contrib.auth.models import User

@receiver(post_save, sender=User)
def signal_handler(sender, instance, **kwargs):
    print("Signal handler: Inside transaction?", transaction.get_connection().in_atomic_block)

# Simulating user creation inside a transaction
with transaction.atomic():
    user = User(username="testuser")
    user.save()

print("Outside of transaction")

Output:
Signal handler: Inside transaction? True
Outside of transaction
This proves that the signal handler runs inside the same database transaction because the signal handler prints True for being inside an atomic block.
